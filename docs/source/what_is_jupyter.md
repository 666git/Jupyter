# What is Jupyter?

"Jupyter" can mean a lot of things, so let's start from the beginning (and break it down):

First and foremost, "Project Jupyter" is a large umbrella project that covers many different software offerings and tools. That includes "Jupyter Notebook" and "JupyterLab", which are both popular web-based notebook authoring and editing applications. The Jupyter project, and its subprojects, all center around providing tools (and standards) for interactive computing with computational notebooks. Each of these will be explored further below.

The term "Jupyter" is often used as a shorthand to refer to one of those products or ideas, which sometimes leads to confusion. Let's take a look at each one of those, one-by-one.

# What is a "Computational Notebook" anyway?

A famous computer programmer (Donald Knuth) popularized the idea to combine explanatory plain english text with computer code, which is commonly called "literate programming".

A program written in this way could be printed on paper and shared by hand as an actual "notebook", but in modern times, they are shared digitally as "notebook files", and can contain additional rich media like images, 3D models and interactive figures, along with data and other program outputs.

By adopting this practice, computer programs, as well as other complex information and ideas, could be better explained to a wide range of people. Because scientists, engineers, and other technical people so often need to perform and communicate sophisticated calculations to describe their work, these "computational notebooks" became a very popular way to share their work and ideas.

When someone uses the term "notebook", they might be referring to:

- A notebook file on their computer
- The idea of combining computer code, explanatory text, images and more into the "notebook format"
- The "Jupyter Notebook" application, used to author and edit digital notebook files

And the term "Jupyter" might refer to:

- "Project Jupyter", the overarching umbrella project
- The "Jupyter Notebook" or "JupyterLab" editing programs

The name Jupyter comes from the three programming languages the project originally supported: Python, Julia, and R.
